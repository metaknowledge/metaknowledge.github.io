            <h2><a href="https://students.washington.edu/huskyws/hws_website/">HWS website</a></h2>
            <p>
                Last year (2024) I became president of Husky Winter Sports which is a ski club at the University of Washington.
                One of my main goals was to improve the website because the old one was hosting on wix which was not a great solution for the future.
                I decide to make the website as simple as possible to minimize the learning curve for future club members when they need to change the website.
                The website is pure html, and the whole site takes up about 7MB, including phots.
            </p>
            <p>
                It has a few cool features like the "skip to main content" button is hidden until you tab. It also has a few animated images and the image carousel. 
                All the interaction is made with css. Css has gotten really good in the past few years, and I see most websites not needing javascript for 90% of functionality in the future.

            <h2><a href="https://huskywintersports.github.io/training-manual/">Training manual</a></h2>
            <p>
                This was also a part of my work with Husky Winter Sports. Its a ski instructor training manual for new members. 
                The website was not designed by me. I used an already existing program called <a href="https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/">Quartz</a> to make the website.
                Very fun to play around with the graph view.

            <p>
                I helped out in recovering the University Kayak Club website. I mostly just move the individual sites to there own pages, and created an page to go to each one. 
                The sites date back to as far as 2000, so over 25 years of website history in there. 
                It was a challenge because each site used a different method to make the site.
                Old html standards, php, or wordpress were all things I had to deal with in order to recover everthing.

            <p>I feel like a personal site should be fun. I am continuously changing the style of my site.</p>

            <p>
                This is my personal blog that I made using the program: <a href="https://barf.btxx.org/">barf</a>.
                Is very simple, but I like it because I can tweak what I need.
                It's also has a very clean look and template for each blog post.
